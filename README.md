# Autoencoder
Constructed 3-layer and 5-layer Neural Networks to find binary code for 16 decimal numbers from 0 to 15, using Keras autoencoder in Python;
Different initial weights, two different activation functions (sigmoid function and Rectified Linear Unit), and different number of perceptrons 
in the hidden layers were used to build autoencoders; Their influences on the stable states of all hidden layers and runtime were examined.
